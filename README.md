# Spatial regression methods on state level polygons, covid19 mortalilty and chronic disease
A final project for an applied data science course. Analysis of crude COVID-19 mortality ratios, diabetes prevalence, 
and spatial autocorrelation with state-level polygons.
Not the most clear results, but an interesting approach to limited data and spatially adjusted logisitic regression models.
